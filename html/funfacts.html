	<header class="header">Origin of Marvel</header>
	<p>Marvel Comics was founded in 1939 as Timely Publications, and it was primarily focused on publishing superhero comics during the Golden Age of Comic Books. In the 1950s, the company's focus shifted to other genres, such as horror, westerns, and romance comics. However, in the 1960s, Marvel experienced a resurgence with the introduction of characters like Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Hulk, and the Fantastic Four. These characters were created by some of the most influential comic book creators of all time, including Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Steve Ditko. Marvel's approach to storytelling and character development was groundbreaking, and it helped to revolutionize the comic book industry. Today, Marvel is one of the most successful and influential entertainment companies in the world, with its characters appearing in films, TV shows, video games, and other media.
